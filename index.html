					<h2 class="major">Why did I make this?</h2>
					<p>What you see here is a collection of various toys and projects I've created over time - most of which were made just for fun or to explore something I found interesting. Despite not being the most complete or impressive things I've built, I believe there's an important lesson to be found here.</p>
					<p>Ever since I started archiving these side projects, I've realized that many aspects of computer science I once thought inaccessible to me are not as unapproachable as they first appeared. The things that awed me as a younger programmer have become more manageable through exploration and practice.</p>
					<p>I published this collection to share a lesson that has hammered itself into me over the years: it's crucial to challenge yourself, even when a topic seems difficult or beyond your understanding. There were times I wanted to dive into certain subjects but felt I just couldn't grasp the research. Even when I did understand the concepts, I doubted my ability to create something that matched the quality of others' implementations.</p>
					<p>If anyone, especially newer programmers, reads this, here's my advice: push yourself a little beyond your comfort zone with each project. Strive for what seems challenging and don't shy away from complex topics. While it's wise not to dive into the most impenetrable subjects right away, aiming for what seems difficult can lead to surprising and meaningful growth.</p>
					<p>So go out and give it a try. You may fail, but there are always valuable lessons to learn along the way. You'll be amazed at how much you can accomplish.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Info about these projects</h2>
					<p>Every project on this site was originally created in Python, primarily using libraries such as Pygame and Tkinter for visual components where applicable.</p>
					<p>None of the original projects were designed with performance, cleanliness, or configurability as a primary concern unless that was required for them to function or was an integral pillar of the idea. They were school assignments, jokes, proofs of concept, and/or ways for me to explore topics I found interesting at the time.</p>
					<p>What you see on the site is, in most cases, a 1-to-1 translation to pure HTML/CSS/JS, with careful attention to recreating the functionality of external libraries when needed. Some have been reimagined or expanded upon, but all have had every knob, slider, option, or dial I could possibly expose made available through, I can only hope, a simple UI.</p>
					<p>I recommend that anyone using this site have a computer and mouse, as I did not account for mobile control when translating these projects.</p>
